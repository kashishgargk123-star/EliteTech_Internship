Task 4 — Digital FIR Filter Design
ELiteTEch Intern — VLSI Internship

Filter Overview
Type: 4-tap FIR, direct form
Coefficients: h = [1, 3, 3, 1] (fixed, sum = 8)
Equation: y[n] = ( x[n] + 3*x[n-1] + 3*x[n-2] + x[n-3] ) / 8
Data width: 8-bit signed
Latency: 1 clock cycle
Throughput: 1 sample per clock cycle (fully pipelined)
This coefficient set is the expansion of (1 + z⁻¹)³, giving a smooth low-pass response with unity DC gain and a null at the Nyquist frequency — see performance_analysis.md for the simulation results that confirm this.

Module Ports (fir_filter)
Port	Direction	Width	Description
clk	input	1	Clock
rst_n	input	1	Active-low synchronous reset
valid_in	input	1	New input sample available
data_in	input	8 (signed)	Input sample x[n]
valid_out	output	1	Output sample available
data_out	output	8 (signed)	Filtered output y[n]
How to Run
Requires Icarus Verilog (iverilog + vvp), and optionally GTKWave to view waveforms.

# Compile
iverilog -o sim_out fir_filter.v tb_fir_filter.v

# Run the simulation
vvp sim_out

# (Optional) view the generated waveform
gtkwave fir_filter.vcd
Expected Results
Test	Input	Output
Impulse response	16, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0	2, 6, 6, 2, 0, 0
Step response	10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10	1, 5, 8, 10, 10, 10
Oscillating (Nyquist) input	20, -20, 20, -20, ...	2, 5, 2, 0, 0, 0, ...
Full explanation of each result is in performance_analysis.md.

Notes
Coefficients (1, 3, 3, 1) are powers-of-two-friendly, so no true hardware multipliers are needed — synthesis tools will implement the ×1 and ×3 multiplies as shifts/shift-adds.

The /8 normalization is done as an arithmetic right shift by 3.
